## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The grid system was a bit tricky to get the first and last column merged... Probably did the most complicated solution, but it worked.

### Continued development

Liking the grid system, so will probably continue with that for a while.
